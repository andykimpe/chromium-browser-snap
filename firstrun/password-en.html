<h1>Password storage in Chromium</h1>
    <p>
    Password storage via the Gnome keyring has been fixed,
    but for it to work, you have to rename your old
    <tt>~/snap/chromium/common/chromium/Default/Login Data</tt>
    file so that a new, working one can replace it.
    </p>

    <p>
    We suggest you to rename it to <tt>Login Data.old</tt>. You can do
    so through your file manager or by opening a terminal and entering
    </p>

    <pre><code>cd ~/snap/chromium/common/chromium/Default/
mv "Login Data" "Login Data.old"</code></pre>

    <p>
    This way, in case something goes wrong (and please file a bug report in
    Launchpad if so), you can always reverse the action by renaming the file
    back to <tt>Login Data</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you want to be meticulously cautious, go to <i>Password Manager</i> in the 
    <i>Settings</i> page (about://settings/passwords), click the
    three dots icon beside <i>Saved Passwords</i> and <i>Export passwords</i>
    as a CSV file, which you can thereafter import to restore your passwords.
    </p>
