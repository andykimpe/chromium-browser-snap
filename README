This is the repository for the official Chromium snap (beta channel).

It follows the beta channel release cadence upstream. I.e., when Google
releases a new version for their beta channel, the snapcraft.yaml in this
repository is updated to download and build that release.

The snap is built for x86 (amd64), ARMv7l (armhf) and ARMv8 (arm64).
