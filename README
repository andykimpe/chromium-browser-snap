This is the repository for the official Chromium snap (stable and candidate
channels).

It follows the stable channel release cadence upstream. I.e., when Google
releases a new version for their stable channel, the snapcraft.yaml in this
repository is updated to download and build that release.

Successful builds are released first in the candidate channel. If they pass
manual and automated tests, the maintainer of the snap promotes them to 
the stable channel, which is the one that the vast majority of users track.

The snap is built for x86 (amd64), ARMv7l (armhf) and ARMv8 (arm64).
