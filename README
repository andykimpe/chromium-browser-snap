This is the repository for the official Chromium snap (edge channel).

It follows the dev channel release cadence upstream. I.e., when Google
releases a new version for their dev channel, the snapcraft.yaml in this
repository is updated to download and build that release.

The dev channel is the first point of contact to upstream change in general.
The snap maintainers also abide by that conduct for downstream changes as well.
For instance, when a new base snap is released, the move will be made first
in dev, then in beta, then finally in stable.

The snap is built for x86 (amd64), ARMv7l (armhf) and ARMv8 (arm64).
